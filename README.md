# üß† Twitter Topic Classification

A Natural Language Processing pipeline for multi-class classification of tweets into six topical categories using TF-IDF vectorization and machine learning models. Built for academic research and evaluation, following the CRISP-DM methodology.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset contains 6,443 human-labeled tweets, each assigned to one of the following categories:

0. Arts & Culture  
1. Business & Entrepreneurs  
2. Pop Culture  
3. Daily Life  
4. Sports & Gaming  
5. Science & Technology  

Each tweet includes the raw text, date, label, and a category name.
